abyss stages:
    in abyss: (on continuous stage)
        clear room -> loot -> reload/recall/repair (if not 3rd room) -> next room
    out of abyss: (can be separated into multiple stages)
        after x runs or supplies are low or inventory is full (80% ?) or ship/drones damaged:
            dock home base -> drop off loot -> pick up supplies -> repair -> undock -> warp to safe spot -> use filament
        else:
            move a bit and use filament
